Dynamic Time Warping ([DTW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping)) is a dynamic programming algorithm for computing similarity between two temporal signals which may differ in speed. The algorithm finds the optimal, non-linear alignment of two input signals and returns a numeric difference for how dissimilar they are.
